They also wrote programs for a TRS-80 computer, such as games, a program to predict model rocket flight, and a word processor. In college, they studied philosophy and AI, and wrote a book about Lisp hacking. They also took art classes and applied to art schools, and while a student at the Accademia, they started painting still lives in their bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because they painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all they could afford at the time. They also arrived at an arrangement with the faculty whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. They even had a little stove, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. The author also painted the model, while the other students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.
