Welcome to LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™ (GPT Index)!
=====================================

LlamaIndex (GPT Index) is a project that provides a central interface to connect your LLM's with external data.

ðŸš€ Overview
-----------

Context
^^^^^^^
- LLMs are a phenomenonal piece of technology for knowledge generation and reasoning. They are pre-trained on large amounts of publicly available data.
- How do we best augment LLMs with our own private data?
- One paradigm that has emerged is *in-context* learning (the other is finetuning), where we insert context into the input prompt. That way, we take advantage of the LLM's reasoning capabilities to generate a response.

To perform LLM's data augmentation in a performant, efficient, and cheap manner, we need to solve two components:

- Data Ingestion
- Data Indexing

Proposed Solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That's where the **LlamaIndex** comes in. LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible interface between your external data and LLMs. It provides the following tools in an easy-to-use fashion:

- Offers `data connectors <http://llamahub.ai>`_ to your existing data sources and data formats (API's, PDF's, docs, SQL, etc.)
- Provides **indices** over your unstructured and structured data for use with LLM's. These indices help to abstract away common boilerplate and pain points for in-context learning:

   - Storing context in an easy-to-access format for prompt insertion.
   - Dealing with prompt limitations (e.g. 4096 tokens for Davinci) when context is too big.
   - Dealing with text splitting.
- Provides users an interface to **query** the index (feed in an input prompt) and obtain a knowledge-augmented output.
- Offers you a comprehensive toolset trading off cost and performance.
